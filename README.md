# Introduction 

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application.

## Importance in The Design Process
- Clarifies Ideas and Concepts
- Facilitates Communication
- Identifies Usability Issues
- Saves Time and Resources
- Provides a Clear Layout and Structure
- Enables Easy Modifications
- Guides the Design Process

## Key Element in a Wireframe
- Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
- Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
- Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
- Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

## Types of Wireframes

High-fidelity Wireframes : More detailed and refined versions, It is typically used at the end of a design process often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

A High-Fidelity Wireframe is used in the Airbnb project.

## Wireframing Tools

- Figma 
Figma is one of the most popular tools for wireframing and UI design. It allows real-time collaboration, making it ideal for teams.
- Adobe XD – Great for both wireframing and interactive prototyping.

- Sketch – A vector-based design tool mainly for macOS users.

- Balsamiq – Focuses on low-fidelity, hand-drawn-style wireframes for quick idea testing.

### Recommended Tool:

Figma is recommended because it combines simplicity, collaboration, and flexibility, allowing designers to quickly go from concept to prototype.

#### Key Features:

- Cloud-based, accessible from any device
- Real-time collaboration and commenting
- Vector-based design tools
- Reusable components and design systems
- Easy transition from wireframe to prototype
